# Stock Lab Work Handoff

Updated: 2026-11-07 KST. Read before inspecting large source files or editing.
Check Git first; this document is not evidence that another computer has no newer edits.

## Resume Safely

1. Run `git status --short`, `git branch --show-current`, `git log -6 --oneline`
   and inspect upstream after `git fetch origin`. Preserve uncommitted/divergent work;
   never reset or force-pull it. Use `pull --ff-only` only on clean, compatible history.
2. Read AGENTS.md, this file and the latest linked measurement record below.
3. Use the installed environment. Home verification used
   `.venv311/Scripts/python.exe`; the other computer used `venv/Scripts/python.exe`.
4. Private exports/screenshots are outside Git and may not exist on another computer.
   Do not commit account data or secrets. Request login only if the UI needs it.

Repository: `https://github.com/kej0587-afk/my-stock-lab.git`, branch `main`.
Production: `https://3insky.streamlit.app/`.

## Current State

Latest bounded refactor: **`051ac66c`**, pushed from clean/equal `11565166`.
Extracted only SMC context assembly into
`stock_lab_core/decision_smc.py::build_decision_smc_context`.
All ten original locals and seven dependency calls retain their order; result
assembly, detector algorithms, charts, thresholds, labels and amounts unchanged.
`calc_scores_and_decision`: 467 -> 463 lines; no measured speedup claimed.
The purpose is responsibility isolation, not merely reducing line count.

Verification: decision gate **1,132 passed before** (93.962s), **1,171 passed after**
(95.224s, 39 new tests). Focused SMC/follow-up/priority/import tests: 174 passed.
Twenty pre-edit full results match; exact unrounded outputs, dependency order,
nonmutation, failure propagation and loaded/stale provenance verified.
No golden files regenerated; immutable reference Git `11565166`.

Post-push GOOGL precision calculation, SMC detail display and review ZIP passed.
New helper loaded/disk/local hashes match; no stale modules/restart required.
No account/watchlist edits. Private UI/ZIP evidence is linked in the record below.

Latest record: [SMC context extraction](docs/maintenance/20261107_decision_smc_extraction.md).

## Preserved History

- `042c0bef`: idempotent ETF exemption writes prevent clearing saved signals on
  precision visits. Decision gate 1045 passed; Cloud retained all 10 connected
  results after the visit. See the connection review below for exact evidence.
- `ff2e8490`: exact-parity MFI window optimization. Selected all gate 1453 passed;
  fixed-input indicator benchmark improved 26.9%. Cloud repeat times were noisy
  (roughly 70s), first-load time did not improve; no sub-minute guarantee.
  Full timing/cache/deployment limits are in the MFI record below.
- Home baseline branch `codex/home-baseline-20261106-29d90955` remains local.
  No user edits were discarded. Private exports/screenshots stay outside Git.

## Next Task Only

**Measure one complete current-build Today Check run and identify its dominant bottleneck.**

The recent bounded extractions preserve behavior but do not establish a speedup.
Do not keep extracting tiny blocks solely to shorten the orchestration function.
Use authenticated production with unchanged account/ticker scope; run Today Check
once, export its completed performance file and matching measurement/build ID.
Separate wall time, self time, nested/parallel cumulative time, actual remote
requests/cache misses and cache state. Do not substitute a partial last_attempt
file or compare different inputs as if like-for-like. Inspect only the dominant
measured path and propose exactly one bounded optimization as the next task.
Do not change rules, TTLs, data scope or portfolio values during measurement.
Keep private exports outside Git; commit/push the measurement record and handoff.

- Workflow: [Bounded refactor review](docs/maintenance/20261106_bounded_refactor_review.md).
- Previous timing IDs are in the MFI record. Connection evidence is in the held-view
  review; latest refactor verification is in the theme extraction record.
  Full JSON/ZIP/screenshots remain outside Git.
- The preceding connection optimization improved its quote segment but not full
  runtime (64.779s -> 66.336s on a different 96-row input). Do not blend those old
  measurements with today's 95-row runs or claim a sub-minute guarantee.
- Broader refactoring and investment-rule redesign remain separate future tasks.
